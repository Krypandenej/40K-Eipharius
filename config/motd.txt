<strong>
You have recently arrived or have been contained for a time within the ice world of Messia, bastioned within the noble frontier systems of the Eminent Domain. Plagued by gravitic storms, the system wanders sloppily through the fringes of Imperial Space, having suffered in it's time two cosmological collisions in it's lifetime. It's rogue star is locked in a drunken dance with Pymbyle Minor, a flirtatious encounter of gravities that would take millions of years to resolve. Rich in ultra-rare metals including ancylitum and phorydnum, Eipharius has been a miner's plunder-haven for as long as it has been identified. 

Disconnected millennia ago from Terra it's inhabitants both human and xenos tragically vanished centuries prior to Imperial Colonization, the grotesque ruins of the old city reclaimed by the Lord Governor over decades with the aid of opulent benefactors. 

The great city of Messina is forever ailing and weak; it is worn out and withering. Many parts of it are crumbling, and there are some parts that are so decayed that no one dares visit them for fear of dislodging a wall or a ragged roof with no more force than the sound of footsteps. The city has always been an old place, with damp around its feet and dust in its mouth. War made this city mighty once. But war brought it to it's knees.
